Contributing to reclab
======================

**Note: This document is a 'getting started' summary for contributing code,
documentation, testing, and filing issues.** Please read it carefully to help
make the code review process go as smoothly as possible and maximize the
likelihood of your contribution being merged.

How to contribute
-----------------

The preferred workflow for contributing to reclab is to fork the
`main repository <https://github.com/tgsmith61591/reclab>`_ on
Github, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:

1. Fork the `project repository <https://github.com/tgsmith61591/reclab>`_
   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This
   creates a copy of the code under your Github user account.

2. Clone your fork of the reclab repo from your Github account to your
   local disk:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ git clone https://github.com/tgsmith61591/reclab.git
       $ cd reclab

3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ git checkout -b my-feature

   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!

4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ git add modified_files
       $ git commit

   to record your changes in Git, then push the changes to your Github account with:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ git push -u origin my-feature

5. Follow `these instructions <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork>`_
to create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.

Pull Request Checklist
----------------------

We recommended (and prefer that) that your contribution complies with the
following rules before you submit a pull request. Failure to adhere to the
rules may hinder the speed with which your contribution is merged:

-  Reclab uses the `gitflow branching model <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_.
   That means all of your feature branches should be merged back to the `develop`
   branch, and *not* `master`!

-  Write detailed docstrings for all of public your functions. The preferred
   format for docstrings is the `numpy standard <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt#docstring-standard>`_.
   Also include usage examples where appropriate. See also the
   `Numpy guidelines for documenting your code  <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

-  Use, when applicable, the validation tools and scripts in the
   `reclab.utils` submodule.

-  Give your merge request a helpful title that summarizes what your
   contribution does. In some cases ``Fix <ISSUE TITLE>`` is enough.
   ``Fix #<ISSUE NUMBER>`` is not enough.

-  If your pull request references an issue, reference it in the body of your
   descriptive text using ``#<ISSUE NUMBER>``

-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with ``[MRG]`` (Ready for
   Merge), if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review.
   The core developers will then review your code and merge when approved.
   An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before
   receiving a full review -- should be prefixed ``[WIP]`` (to indicate a work
   in progress) and changed to ``[MRG]`` when it matures. WIPs may be useful
   to: indicate you are working on something to avoid duplicated work,
   request broad review of functionality or API, or seek collaborators.

-  All other tests pass when everything is rebuilt from scratch. Note that this
   will actually require a Spark distribution to work locally.
   On Unix-like systems, check with (from the toplevel source folder):

      .. code-block:: bash

          $ python setup.py develop
          $ pytest

   You may need to see the :ref:`setup` section for instructions on how
   to build the package. For instructions on how to test (using nose or pytest)
   see `Numpy's testing instructions <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/TESTS.rst.txt>`_.

.. _filing_bugs:

Filing bugs
-----------
We use Github issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to
open an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.

It is recommended to check that your issue complies with the
following rules before submitting:

-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other
   `issues <https://github.com/tgsmith61591/reclab/issues>`_
   or `pull requests <https://github.com/tgsmith61591/reclab/pulls>`_.

-  If your issue references and pull request, reference it in the body of your
   descriptive text using ``!<PULL REQUEST NUMBER>``

-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well
   as your Python, numpy, implicit, annoy, nmslib, and reclab versions. This
   information can be found by running the following code snippet:

  .. code-block:: python

      import platform; print(platform.platform())
      import sys; print("Python", sys.version)
      import numpy; print("NumPy", numpy.__version__)
      import implicit; print("Implicit", implicit.__version__)
      import annoy; print("Annoy", annoy.__version__)
      import nmslib; print("Nmslib", nmslib.__version__)
      import reclab; print("Reclab", reclab.__version__)
