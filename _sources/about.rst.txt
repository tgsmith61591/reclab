About reclab
============

Reclab is a practical library for recommenders that wraps the Implicit package,
providing various cross-validation & model selection tools

|

Why?
----

There are a million papers and books about recommender systems, but the practical
code availability is very limited. While you could follow 50 different Medium articles
about building a bespoke recommender system, reclab was built to fill a perceived gap
in open source recommender libraries.

The goal of reclab is to provide a user-friendly library of out-of-the-box recommender
solutions similar to scikit-learn.

What does it have to offer?
---------------------------

Though reclab internally wraps other implementations of recommender systems, it
offers a lot more than just the algorithms themselves:

* A consistent API (more than can be said for most libraries in the field)

* Model selection utilities, such as:

  * :ref:`train_test`
  * Cross-validation
  * Grid searches

* Scoring metrics & evaluation utilities

* Model persistence
