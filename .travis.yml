# The Travis build will test both Linux AND OSX distributions, but language
# needs to be overridden to "generic" for Mac, otherwise the build will fail
# until Python is downloaded via Homebrew (which is handled in the
# before_install.sh). Note that none of the test envs or wheels test/create
# artifacts on <64 bit Linux or Mac. All artifacts are 64-bit ONLY.
